This directory contains scripts to process and analyze the data associated with this project. All details and documentation are within the scripts themselves.

[main.R](main.R) can be run to reproducibly generate all manuscript results. It will call individual scripts in the [data-processing](data-processing/) and [analysis-scripts](analysis-scripts/) directories. Scripts in these directories can also be run and explored individually so long as all directories to which dataframes are written have been created and the files necessary for the scripts to run have been downloaded or created.
